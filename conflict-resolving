When git pull complains about conflicts:

- ensure you don't have uncommitted changes:
  $ git diff --cached
  ... if they aren't your changes:
  $ git reset HEAD
  ... if they are your changes:
  $ git commit -m "explanation of the changes"
- ensure that you are where you want to be:
  $ git checkout master (or whatever branch you were working on)
- get the remote changes:
  $ git pull (you can explicitly tell to git pull origin master)
- git diff should give you the conflicts
  $ git diff
- edit them away by hand 
  $ gedit some-file-that-conflicted)
- Commit your resolution of the changes:
  $ git commit -am "resolving conflict, <explanation>"
- Try if the push is now clean
  $ git push
- If it isn't, retry pulling...
